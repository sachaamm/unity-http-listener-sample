# unity-http-listener-sample
This project is a unity project sample using the [unity-http-listener](https://github.com/sachaamm/unity-http-listener) embedded as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). This project looks like a real project embedding [unity-http-listener](https://github.com/sachaamm/unity-http-listener) 
including config files. Please see the [unity-http-listener](https://github.com/sachaamm/unity-http-listener) README for infos.
